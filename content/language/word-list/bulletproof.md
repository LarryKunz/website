# Term: Bulletproof

## Definition
*Bulletproof* is typically used in the context of cybersecurity to describe systems or applications that are relatively free from vulnerabilities.

*Bulletproof* is also used sometimes in marketing communication when comparing products or services to those offered by competitors. The implication is that the product or service can withstand the claims of the competition.

## Recommendation
Recommended to replace when possible.

## Recommended Replacements
Depending on context, the Inclusive Naming Initiative recommends the following alternative terms.

In the cybersecurity context:
- Secure
- Safe
- Protected

In the technical/software marketing contexts:
- Robust

## Unsuitable Replacements 
Not applicable

## Rationale
The word *bulletproof* is associated with gun violence, especially in the United States. Some individuals find the term especially threatening or offensive.

In the context of cybersecurity, bulletproof suggests that something is completely invulnerable, which is unrealistic. No system or application is invulnerable. The term also demands that the reader understand a metaphor, which is unnecessary when there exist several clear, straightforward alternatives.
